# 🔧 How Do Custom Assets Work?
Wrapper Offline loads character parts (like clothes, face shapes, ears, eyes, eyebrows, nose, mouth, and hairs) from folders each time you open the Character Creator. By replacing these folders with remastered or custom ones, the app displays new visuals automatically.

When you install a custom pack:
* It overwrites default assets
* The changes appear immediately in the UI
* It updates clothes, facial features, and even expressions
# 🌐 Where to Get Custom Asset Packs?
* MediaFire (JCWCACV7.0 ZIP folder pack)
* Internet Archive (By searching “Wrapper Offline custom assets” or “JCWCAC” in the search bar)
* ⚠️ Sometimes you need to scan ZIP folders and ZIP files, then always check trusted creators.
